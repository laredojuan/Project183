Roosters are considered auspicious because their crowing sounds like the Chinese words for “fame” and “merit.”</p><p>Roosters are smart, charming, witty, honest, blunt, capable, talented, brave, and self-reliant. They are known for their ability to do astounding things with extremely limited resources. Their way is always right (in their mind, at least), and they love to debate their stance. Roosters are extremely sociable and bask in attention and praise.</p><p>Those born in the year of the Rooster are attractive and very fine dressers no matter what the cost, and they’ll spend whatever time it takes to achieve just the right look – though they will always be punctual. They are organized, a trait that’s reflected in their orderly homes.</p><p>Roosters dream big, set huge goals, and then work like crazy to achieve what they desire. For all their brashness, Roosters are loyal and will go to extremes to please their partners. Still, they can be controlling, insensitive, narrow-minded, selfish, and reckless.</p>`,

Dogs are extremely faithful and supportive to friends and family.

The Pig is often portrayed with a fat head and big ears (big ears are considered auspicious). So important was the Pig to the economy of ancient China that the Chinese word for “home” is made up of the ideograms for roof and Pig.</p><p>Pigs are noble – born with an innate sense of fair play and honesty, they are intelligent, thoughtful, creative, responsible, and have an intense thirst for knowledge. Though self-reliant and good with money, Pigs are usually lucky enough for help to materialize when needed.</p><p>Pigs are not impressed with wealth or status, and they’re extremely generous. They love to socialize and have no trouble making and keeping friends. They are loyal, compassionate, intuitive, optimistic, and have a good sense of humor.</p><p>Pigs have an enormous appetite for all the pleasures of life. They need to beware of over-indulging, and to learn how to discriminate about what and who is worthy of their big-hearted attention. Pigs are romantic, affectionate, and monogamous once they commit to a relationship.</p>`,
